## About The Project

[![Employee_Manager][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/JamesF905/Employee_Manager)

This challenge requires me to create a command line application that will allow a user to view and edit their employees, departments, and rolls. It uses node.js as a backend and npm inquirer as a prompt, to send and recieve data from a MySql database.
